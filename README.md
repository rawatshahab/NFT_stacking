NFT-Stacking website 
use command npm i in both directories i.e. api and client 
use command nodemon server.js in api directory to start api 
use command npm run dev in client directory .

if api directory  shows error you can change the port number in api/server.js 
and again that server.js and 
also update the port on the client directory   src/FileUpload.jsx



congrats your NFT-Stacking website is good to go
